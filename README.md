# IEEE 754 decimal bitstrings

This library implements conversion between Rust's primitive number types, numbers encoded as text, and decimal bitstrings of arbitrary precision as specified in IEEE 754 (the standard that also covers Rust's `f32` and `f64` types).

It's still an early prototype, but is mostly functional. I've written it mainly as a way to try explore and understand the decimal arithmetic standard.

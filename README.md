# IEEE 754 decimal bitstrings

This library implements an IEEE 754 decimal floating point compatible encoding in Rust.

It's intended to support the exchange and storage of arbitrary precision numbers in a consistent and portable way.

The source is written to be explorable for anybody interested in understanding the IEEE 754 standards for decimal floating points, and hackable for anybody wanting to adapt parts of the implementation for their own needs.

# Status

This library is quite new. It's functional, but not optimized and likely contains bugs.
